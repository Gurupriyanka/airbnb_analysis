The project aims to enhance the Airbnb experience for hosts and guests across Canadian cities by conducting a detailed analysis of listing data, location of listings, listings images verification, listings price prediction and sentiment and collocation analysis of user reviews. The objective is to identify the features that significantly impact pricing and contribute to higher user ratings thereby empowering hosts to refine pricing strategies and improve user satisfaction by authenticating the property pictures present in the listings. Data from the World City Centers dataset and prominent college locations are utilized for spatial analysis, determining whether proximity to these areas influence listing prices or user ratings. Furthermore, by conducting sentiment analysis and contextual examination of user reviews, the project derives sentiment categories and offers insights into areas that require attention and commendable aspects of listings.
